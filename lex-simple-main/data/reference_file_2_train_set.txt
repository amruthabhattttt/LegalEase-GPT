While a federal court may exercise authority to hear additional claims over state law claims “that are so related to claims in the action within [the Court’s] original jurisdiction that they form a part of the same case or controversy under Article III of the United States Constitution,” a court may decline to hear the claim where it “has rejected all claims over which it has original jurisdiction.” Indeed, unless “consideration of judicial economy, convenience and fairness to parties” weigh in favor of the exercise of the Court exercising authority to hear additional claims, “a federal court should hesitate to exercise jurisdiction over state claims.” Because Claimants argument fails to state an applicable federal claim, and because this case is at the beginning stages of the case, the Court declines to exercise authority to hear additional claims over Claimants state law claims at this time.
