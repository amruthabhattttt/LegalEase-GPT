As for BlueCard claims administered by BCBSTX, the BlueCard program allows beneficiaries to access their coverage when receiving medical services in a state other than the one in which their plans are based. For this, they should be covered by out-of-state Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans.
See, e.g., United States v. McCall, 235 F.3d 1211, 1216 (10th Cir.2000) (noting the applicability of the American Rule to “respective financial burdens of litigating civil claims”); see also Fox v. Vice, 563 U.S. 826, 131 S.Ct.
If so, whether a person’s entitlement to proceeds under a death benefit or retirement plan, paid upon the death of the person making the designation, constitutes “personal property ... not disposed of by will” within the meaning of New York Estates, Powers & Trusts Law section 3-5.1(b)(2)?

Another witness further averred that “there was another occasion ... Sept. 24-Oct. 14, 2010, SPC Meyer was in the changing bay dancing around, bouncing around, and acting as if nothing was physically wrong.” AR-873.
But the bottom line is the more protection, if you will, we can provide for the families of those who are going through what has to be just the most horrific time in their life. I think we have an obligation to do it.
In this matter, Dr. Pence offers four opinions: (1) BSC did not conduct adequate testing of the Pinnacle product prior to placing them on the market; (2) the Pinnacle product was inadequately labeled; (3) patients could not adequately consent to the surgical implantation of the Pinnacle due to the misbranding of these products; and (4) BSC failed to meet the post-market vigilance standard of care for their products, leading to further mis-branding.
§ 1208.18(a)(1); see also Makieh v. Holder, 572 F.3d 37, 44 (1st Cir.2009) (evaluating a claim for CAT protection and explaining that “the administrative record does not ... support a conclusion contrary to that reached by the agency, much less compel a contrary conclusion”).
Roach — at least insofar as the thin recitation of the facts in that case allows us to gather — the only way for the claimant to restore contractual rights lost as a result of the defendant’s unlawful interference was to bring a suit against the third party.
Broad cautionary bans that do not fully address the substantive issue of legitimate concern of the state cannot withstand interim scrutiny. 838 F.3d at 73 (quoting Members of City Council of City of L.A. v. Taxpayers for Vincent, 466 U.S. 789, 810, 104 S.Ct.

The reason for the application is that the claims are insignificant or that there is no claim for which compensation can be granted. He was notified of three strike situations by multiple courts.”); Deen-Mitchell v. Young, No.
the accused state agency and individual actors created danger or increased plaintiffs' vulnerability; (2) the suer was a member of a limited and specifically identifiable group; (3) respondents' conduct places suer at risk of serious, direct, and imminent harm; (4) the risk was obvious or known; (5) the respondents acted recklessly in conscious disregard of this risk; and (6) such behavior is, on the whole, deliberately shocking.
Look at the decisions; Stevens v. Steams, 2003 VT 74, ¶¶ 14—21, 175 Vt. 428, 833 A.2d 835; Murray v. White, 155 Vt. 621, 627-631, 587 A.2d 975, 978-981 (1991).

§ 287.7(d) is titled “Temporary detention upon request of the Department.” § 287.7(a) appears to generally define the detainer as a “claim.” It is difficult to understand that the word “shall” is used in the timing section in a way that changes the nature of the entire arrangement.
18, 2014 ('Record Date'), pursuant to the Plan, fund units were held on the Record Date. He is entitled to an initial distribution of $0.155570 USD per unit. (A44, ¶ 16; A571)
“An act dangerous to human life…an act deliberately reckless and immoral, with complete disregard for human life and social duty, and tending to cause deliberate mischief” is sufficient to prove “maliciousness.” State v. Davis, 197 N.C.App.
There is no such unfair prejudice in this case because the State of South Dakota filed suit in state court voluntarily, at a time of its own choosing, with carefully selected defendants. Moreover, FAG Bearings can be separable.
"The change in wording is intended to demonstrate that administrative law judges are not in the business of accusing the character of suers. Clearly, judges will evaluate the credibility of applicants' stinging allegations. This is especially true since such allegations often cannot be relied upon or declined on the basis of medical evidence." Cole v. Colvin, 831 F.3d 411, 412 (7th Cir.
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(f) allows courts to “enter suit pleading insufficient pleadings or any unnecessary, trivial, obscene, or scandalous matter.” The aim of the respondents' strike request is not defense. Instead, it is the content of the respondents’ responsive resolution and sworn testimony.
Due to this, courts apply “strict examination if the contested classification jeopardizes the exercise of a fundamental right or classifies individuals according to a questionable characteristic such as foreignness, look at; Banner v. United States, 428 F.3d 303, 307 (D.C.Cir.2005); Hunt v. Cromartie, 526 U.S. 541, 546, 119 S.Ct.
The suer talked about certain circumstances almost every month between January 2009 and December 2009 and the reason for her treatment. Among these; breathlessness and body pain; rapid heartbeat; feeling like dying; and a continuous cough and spit.
38, 45-46 (6th Cir.2007) states: “[T]he Plan’s overpayment provision alleges a right to recover from a specific fund distinct from [the employee’s] assets — the fund being the overpayments themselves — and a particular share of that fund to which the plan was entitled. This includes all overpayments due to the receipt of Social Security benefits, but not to exceed the amount of benefits paid.”
Under the agreements, BP is referred to as the "Pipeline Owner" or "Operator" and it assigned these rights to Plains and TPC Pipeline Company (and its parent company, Tosco Corporation). It also transferred its rights as "Pipeline Lessee" and "Refinery Owner" to Phillips.
The court considers the pleadings, answers, evidence, counsel's argument, and applicable law. Accordingly, it will grant the resolution for summary judgment, deny the suers' claims, and deny all other pending resolutions for other reasons.
Therefore, the Court should grant the respondents' demand for decline if it answers in the positive to three questions: (1) whether the respondents "are a provider of interactive computer services," 47 U.S.C.
Such a need arises when: (1) failure to provide hurry-up processing would pose an “looming threat to the life or physical safety of an individual”; or (2) the requester is “primarily engaged in disseminating information” and “demonstrates an urgency to notify the public about actual or alleged Federal Government activity.” 5 U.S.C.
The intake questionnaire, a document used by a potential complainant to file a charge of discrimination under the ADA with the EEOC, can itself create a charge when it contains "information required by the regulations, i.e., an allegation and the name of the accused party,”. Additionally, in cases where "the file could reasonably be interpreted as a request for the agency to take remedial action to protect the employee's rights or resolve a dispute between the employer and the employee," such as when the "filer makes a request," it may be considered a fee acceptable. The agency needs to activate its machines and improvement processes. Fed.

Although Morgan Stanley has not yet moved for summary judgment on plaintiffs' negligent misrepresentation claims, I have ordered plaintiffs to show cause why their negligent misrepresentation claims against Morgan Stanley should not be declined. This was in light of my finding that Morgan Stanley did not make an actionable misrepresentation to suers.
In addition to its decision in Short, the court also examined the decisions of other circuits. Accordingly, it decided that "the first disclosure of a crime to the spouse falls within the scope of the marital communication privilege." Id.
Chapter 13 debtor Gary D. Barbee (“Debtor”) filed suit against US Bank National Association as trustee of Truman FHA Trust 2008-1. To do this, it used mortgage servicing agency BAC Home Loan Servicing (“Bank”). The cause of action is 11 U.S.C. The cause of the suit was that he sought to avoid the Bank's interest in his manufactured home under 11 U.S.C.
ECMC, the respondent in both Walker cases, had inappropriately determined this as a subject matter jurisdiction issue. The reasoning behind this is that because student loans are not discharged unless clearly stated, a general order of discharge is not final as to such loans.
For reference, other creditors will be collectively referred to as the "Lender Group". Mittman, as their representative, engaged in extensive litigation with the Judgment Creditors regarding the Debtor's right to receive approximately $841,000.00 due from Vonage.
First, the court must "take into account the elements necessary to the suer’s defence." Second, the court must find that the claims “are not entitled to the presumption of fact because they are nothing more than conclusions.” Finally, “where there are well-defended factual claims, the court must assume their truth and then determine whether they give rise to a reasonable right to relief.”
Likewise, a reasonable jury might find, through subsequent confirmation, that this constitutional violation was attributable to ASORT, as noted below with respect to the municipal defendants (see Wright, 138 F.Supp.2d at 957-58) or through motiıns of Commander Combs and Team Leader Miller, who have unlimited discretion to determine how the announcement will be carried out (see Doc.
A mutual insurance exchange is “in its purest form…a network of contractual relationships between subscribers who agree to insure each other, completed through a common agent holding power of attorney.” The most important question is whether USAA is properly treated as a corporation or an unincorporated association for diversity jurisdiction purposes.
Martinez said that during his medical examination the day after he arrived at the Federal Detention Center, he told the nurse that he got beated. Examining Martinez's Health Screening form and based on her memories of Martinez, Pascale is 100 percent certain that Martinez did not tell her he was injured, nor did she see any injuries.
Here, the suer relied on the president's sworn statement. He claimed that his stock ownership [in Patriot Lines and Ship Operations] was limited to Brophys. He asserted that the two companies were 'a front for [Brophys'] operations. (Document no).
893 or simply needs the implementation of an institutional policy. For this, see, UDC Presidents, 56 F.3d at 1474 (note that “if deprivation depends on a policy decision rather than on the characteristics of an individual, a pre-deprivation trial will do little to reduce the risk of wrongful deprivation”).
In the document, Aired alleges that respondents engaged in discriminatory and retaliatory behavior that led to her termination. She asserts that respondents violated her rights under the following laws: (1) Age Discrimination in Employment Act, 29 U.S.C.

For instance, Mr Marriner stated this in the period between 19 June and 31 December 2007. The wind blew only three percent from Dragon's furnace onto the Darneys' property. However, about ten to twelve percent blew from the Dragon's furnace to Midas.
The guarantor may decide for himself and the person to be assured whether a claim or action in respect of a Note shall be settled, defended or appealed on the basis of liability, suitability or other belief.
Therefore, Jackson's allegations failed to prove Chief Surber's personal involvement in Jackson's arrest. He also failed to adequately assert a claim regarding supervisory responsibility under § 1983. Therefore, I grant the deman to decline these allegations regarding Chief Surber.
CFIT [sic] received financial support for this case from Internet domain registrars and pre-order service providers. This includes Pool.com, Inc. (“Pool.com”), Momentous, Inc. (“Momentous”) and R. Lee Chambers Company, LLC. They are collectively called “CFIT Supporters.”
MHV applies to a higher court because of that decision. They argue that the criterion determining the outcome,especially the emphasis on the applicant's plan to broadcast to underserved populations, violates either the Communications Act of 1934, which mandates equitable license distribution, or the Administrative Procedure Act because of arbitrariness.
He asserted three federal claims: (1) the defendants, acting both individually and jointly, and allegedly in conspiracy, deprived Beaman of a fair trial by withholding significant evidence, thus violating Brady (individual liability). (2) that the defendants conspired to deprive Beaman of evidence (conspiracy liability); and (3) the defendants did not intervene to prevent the violation of their rights (non-interference with liability).
Once accepted into the Minnesota Department of Corrections (“MDOC”) system, Brooks was subjected to a chemical dependency test that all new inmates are required to have under Minnesota law. It was later decided to transfer him to a lower security prison, give him a work permit and complete his treatment to avoid disciplinary sanctions.
Despite the requirement for respondent to process the request for a final decision within sixty (60) days, and the ability to compel suer to file a civil suit within ninety (90) days from the issuance of a final decision, repsondent failed to file a final decision until a month after suer’s civil suit was started.
Underwriting objectives include, among other things, the decision whether to issue a policy, the amount and terms of coverage, and whether to renew or cancel a policy.However, it is not necessary for the insurer to obtain a consumer report in order to evaluate the claim.
First, he argues that the second degree court abused its discretion in admitting the 2006 interview clips, his letter to the prisoner, and the facts he acknowledged in his plea agreement to the 2006 crime. This, he says, is because the danger of unfair prejudice significantly outweighs the evidential value.
Although we believe that the NTSB acted arbitrarily and capriciously in refusing to consider state law requiring Petitioner to pay for legal representation, we highlight several issues on which we have not decided. These issues are left open to the NTSB. Additionally, based on the statute at issue, we hold that Petitioner was subject to fees that entitle him to change fees.
Similarly, in American Power & Light, the Court approved a delegation to the SEC to take actions as necessary to prevent companies from “unfairly or inequitably distributing] voting power among security holders.” 329 U.S. at 104-05, 67 S.Ct.
Witness, for example,  his continued highlights that Mr. Mitchell could have appealed the September 2003 decision, challenged its determination that new and material evidence had not been submitted, and point out that the VA never respond to the audiogram from December 1973. However, he neglected to address these points, as noted in a previous post at 445. This omission is particularly noteworthy given that the Federal Circuit had previously dismissed nearly identical objections in the Beraud case, as indicated in 766 F.3d at 1406, note 1.
Within this authority, we can "examine the [Veterans Court's] decision on whether to grant a mandamus request that raises a valid legal concern ... We cannot assess the factual aspects of the veteran's claim, but we can assess whether the petitioner has met the legal criteria for granting the writ." Beasley v. Shinseki, 709 F.3d 1154, 1158 (Fed.Cir.).
The date the veteran was admitted to a non-VA hospital and maintained at VA expense will be considered the date of receiving the claim, if VA maintenance was previously approved. However, if VA maintenance was approved after admission, the date VA received notice of admission will be accepted.
That record also mentioned that on that day, the court declared the defendant guilty as charged in the information and directed a Judgment of Conviction to be recorded on the record.... The court instructed the defendant to be returned to the custody of the Milwaukee County Sheriffs Department."
The issue here is whether an insured can collect settlements from its subcontractors, independently determine that they will be assigned to damages not covered by insurance, and follow he insurers that would cover those damages if the loss was correctly attributed to that policy.

While the title mentions wartime, section 1157 expands the compensation rates outlined in sub-chapter II "to veterans who served during a period of war and also during any other time, and who have incurred a disability in the line of duty during each period of service."
Definition 1 states that personal injury includes injury, including consequential bodily injury, resulting from one or more of the following offenses: ... (e) oral or written publication, in any manner, of material that violates a person's right to privacy.
Section 77p(b) is considered a preclusion provision rather than a preemption provision, as SLUSA doesn't directly replace state law with federal law, but renders certain state-law claims non-actionable through class-action suits in both federal and state courts. In re Kingate Mgmt.
The Second Amended Complaint indicates that the relator alleges Boston Heart's claims were "legally false" because, according to the relator, Boston Heart certified that the tests it conducted were medically necessary, even though they were not medically necessary for certain populations.

Courts can only grant a writ of mandamus if three conditions are met: 1) the petitioner must prove that there are no other satisfactory means to achieve the desired relief, ensuring that the writ is not a substitute for the regular appeals process, 2) the petitioner must establish an unequivocal and indisputable right to the writ, and 3) the court must be persuaded, considering the circumstances, that issuing the writ is justified.
As clarified by the Seventh Circuit, while parties are not required to employ specific language to plead alternately, they must utilize a structure from which it can be reasonably inferred that this was their intention. Holman v. Indiana, 211 F.3d 399, 407 (7th Cir.).
Refer to DeLaRosa v. Peake, 515 F.3d 1319, 1322 (Fed.Cir.2008) ("[t]he board made a factual finding that a medical opinion was not necessary to decide the claim under § 5103A(d) ... [o]ur jurisdiction precludes us from reviewing factual findings or even the application of law to facts").
In accordance with § 2K2.1(a)(4)(B), then an additional 2 levels were applied because the defendant possessed between three and seven firearms, as per § 2K2.1(b)(1)(A), and an additional 4 levels were applied because the defendant possessed the firearms in connection with another felony, specifically drug distribution, as per § 2K2.1(b)(6)(B).
While our dissenting colleagues seek to differentiate the Court action here from the action taken in Leavey based on the assertion that the en banc order in this case was "procedural," this characterization overlooks the fact that the en banc order in Rickett was comparable to a dispositive order. It disposed of a substantive legal matter by accepting a misfiled Notice of Appeal and served as the foundation for permitting the appeal to proceed.
Second, Plaintiff alleges that Tracy-Ramirez’s “career focus has been in the area of Women’s Studies and victim advocacy. his includes authoring papers and delivering presentations on sexual assault and methods to support victims of sexual assault. (ECF No. [insert reference])
It is an unfair labor practice for a labor organization to, among other things, “interfere with, restrain, or coerce any employee in the exercise by the employee of any right under” the chapter of the CSRA concerning union and labor rights, or "to otherwise fail or refuse to comply with any provision of this chapter." 5 U.S.C.

Refer to Flores v. Nicholson, 476 F.3d 1379, 1382 (Fed.Cir.2007), where it was determined that, despite the appellant's effort to frame the issue as an equal protection violation, the court lacked jurisdiction to consider it. This was because her argument on this matter seemed directed at the merits of her claim and did not raise a distinct constitutional issue.
Due to this determination, there is no need to examine whether section 5121 of title 38 might not be applicable to FVECF (Federal Veterans’ Education and Compensation Benefits Expansion Act) claims because section 5121 could potentially be overridden by ARRA (American Recovery and Reinvestment Act) section 1002(c), which governs the extent of FVECF survivor claims.
At trial, the Government has presented two individuals referred to as "cooperating witnesses," who are purportedly co-conspirators of the defendants. These individuals have pleaded guilty and are "cooperating" with the Government by providing testimony during the trial with the expectation of receiving a reduction in their sentences.
The obligation that the VA had to reassess Mr. Blubaugh's claim in view of his DA Form 20 was fulfilled in 1993 when it reopened his claim. Despite having this newly associated service record, the VA once again denied Mr. Blubaugh's claim on the grounds of its merits.
At least 5 percent, but less than 20 percent, of the entire body, or at least 5 percent, but less than 20 percent, expose areas affected, or; intermittent systemic therapy such as corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive drugs required for a total duration of less than six weeks during the past 12-month period...............10[%]

The other sections of § 3.312(c) contain requirements that seem to address the materiality of a condition that contributes to the cause of death. For example, § 3.312(c)(4) states, "there is for consideration whether there may be a reasonable basis for holding that a service-connected condition was of such severity as to have a material influence in accelerating death" (emphasis added).

The Audit Report also acknowledged only partial compliance with Standard 2100, specifically regarding "a broader and more formalized approach in performing risk assessment procedures than is currently in practice at Chipotle." Additionally, IA expressed the belief that the level of detail required by Standard 2100 is not necessary or suitable in the Chipotle environment."
In addition, the Secretary states that “it is clear [that DC] 5284 is not applicable in this case,” as the straightforward language of that DC "precludes rating a foot condition ... that was not the result of an in-service injury." (Reference: Id.)
Darren L. DeFlanders ("DeFlanders") appeals from the decisions of the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims ("Veterans Court") affirming the decisions of the Board of Veterans' Appeals ("the Board"): (i) finding that DeFlanders had not submitted new and material evidence sufficient to reopen claims for service-connected disability compensation for a left knee disability and spots on the lungs; (ii) denying compensation for spots on the brain; and (iii) denying a disability rating in excess of 10% for non-cardiac chest pain.
Implicit in the Secretary's argument, which aligns with the appellant's, is that the December 2006 Board addressed two separate matters: the effective date and disability rating, each of which can be independently reviewed by the Court or revised based on Clear and Unmistakable Error (CUE). These issues pertain to the appellant's claim for disability compensation for bilateral hearing loss.
The Board did not commit an error in determining that "[t]he period between VA's receipt of notice in January 2009 and its response in September 2009 does not alter the fact that the veteran had knowledge, nor does it lessen his responsibility." (Reference: R. at 9)
616 F.3d 1293, 1297 (Fed.Cir.2010) (Following the determination that "there is no valid basis to differentiate between formal and informal claims," the court concluded that "the implicit denial rule can be applied to conclude the pending status of both formal and informal claims").
See Jensen, 2014 WL 1745042, at *5 ("If a consumer is aware of the false statement, then such a person cannot be misled by that statement he or she knows to be false." - citing Kromelbein v. Envision Payment Solutions, Inc., No. [insert reference])

Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1358, 1363 n. 1 (Fed.Cir.2009) (observing that "Congress ... enacted provisions to allow substitution of accrued-benefits claimants as a matter of course" and referencing the Veterans' Benefits Improvement Act of 2008, Pub.L. [insert reference]).
Consequently, the Regional Office (RO) granted Mr. Delisle a 100 percent disability rating for the period from April 7, 2010, to May 31, 2011. Following May 31, 2011, a 60 percent rating was assigned, along with a total disability rating based on individual employability.
Rite-Hite Corp. v. Kelley Co., Inc., 56 F.3d 1538, 1546 n. 4 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (en banc) (quoting W. Page Keeton et al., Prosser & Keeton on the Law of Torts § 41, at 264 (5th ed.))
Thus, the VA's interpretation of § 3.307(a)(6)(iii) — "as excluding service members who never set foot within the land borders of Vietnam" because there was a low probability that offshore veterans, such as Mr. Haas, were exposed to herbicides — was not unreasonable, "plainly erroneous, or inconsistent with the regulation." (Reference: Id.)
There is no indication on the face of the April 1988 rating decision that the RO did not consider the evidence of record or the application of § 4.16(b), and the Court cannot conclude that it failed to do so based solely on silence.
However, the April 2007 and July 2007 VA examinations, the December 2009 private opinion, and the October 2012 opinion from the Director, which constitute the most probative and comprehensive medical evidence, indicate that Mr. Wages's service-connected disabilities did not prevent him from securing non-strenuous or sedentary employment.
Although the Board acknowledged the potential applicability of DC 5280 in light of Mr. Copeland's diagnosis of hallux valgus, it concluded that his condition was only "slight to moderate without surgical resection," and therefore, a separate disability rating was not justified.
Thus, he argues, "[i]t is incongruous to conclude that the [appellant's service-connected bilateral foot disability is 'pronounced' under DC 5276, which is considered a more severe degree of symptomatology than 'severe,' but does not amount to 'severe' under DC 5284." (Reference: Id.)
