The aim was “to eliminate abusive debt collection practices by debt collectors, to insure that those debt collectors who refrain from using abusive debt collection practices are not competitively disadvantaged, and to promote consistent State action to protect consumers against debt collection abuses.” 15 U.S.C.
Since the common-law privilege Defendants invoke overlaps with but is harder to establish than qualified immunity, the Defendants’ argument on that score “is not successful for essentially the same reasons already set forth.” District of Columbia v. Minor, 740 A.2d 523, 531 (D.C.1999) (providing that the standard for common-law privilege “looks like the section 1983 probable cause and qualified immunity standards ... (with the added clear articulation of the requirement of good faith)”); cf.
Several circuits have decided that merely placing child pornography in a shared folder on a file sharing network justifies application of a distribution enhancement. However no circuit has used the Sentencing Guidelines definition of “distribution” to interpret the meaning of the term in § 2252(a)(2).
The Government argues that Mr. Haddad is not qualified to sue for the ’844 patent, since Mr. Haddad transferred all substantial rights in the ’844 patent to sole exclusive licensee Astornet, Gov’t Mot.
Promotion restrictions are not punitive in nature and should not be used as such. They are aimed to allow commanders a minimum period of time to observe a Marine whose conduct or performance has given the commander and/or the Commandant of the Marine Corps (CMC) reason to doubt whether the Marine is ready to assume the duties and responsibilities of the next higher grade.
The contracting officer tries to select the approach that will provide the best overall value to the Government, understanding that the “relative importance of cost .of price may change” Id, For example, when “the requirement is clearly definable and the risk of unsuccessful contract performance is minimal, cost or price may play a dominant role in source selection.” Id.
A decision is accepted  “final and ... can be appealed where it 1) resolves and seriously affects substantive rights and 2) finally determines the discrete issue to which it is addressed.” Dye v. Brown (In re AFI Holding, Inc.), 530 F.3d 832, 836 (9th Cir.2008) (quoting Schulman v. California (In re Lazar), 237 F.3d 967, 985 (9th Cir.2001)).
When a federal court sits in diversity, it “has personal jurisdiction over a  defendant who is not resident if (1) an applicable state long-arm statute gives jurisdiction and (2) the assertion of that jurisdiction is in accordance with constitutional due process.” Nichols v.

But the bottom line is the more protection, if you will, we can provide for the families of those who are going through what has to be just the most horrific time in their life, I think we have an obligation to do it.
In this matter, Dr. Pence has four opinions: (1) BSC did not make adequate testing of the Pinnacle product before placing them on the market; (2) the Pinnacle product was inproperly labeled; (3) patients could not adequately consent to the surgical implantation of the Pinnacle because of the misbranding of these products; and (4) BSC did not satisfy the post-market vigilance standard of care for their products, leading to further mis-branding.

Roach — at least insofar as the thin recitation of the facts in that case allows us to gather — the only way for the plaintiff to claim contractual rights lost as a result of the defendant’s tortious interference was to take an action against the third party.
Broad cautionary bans that do not fully address the substantive issue of legitimate concern of the state cannot withstand interim scrutiny. 838 F.3d at 73 (quoting Members of City Council of City of L.A. v. Taxpayers for Vincent, 466 U.S. 789, 810, 104 S.Ct.

The intake questionnaire, a document used by a potential complainant to file a charge of discrimination under the ADA with the EEOC, can itself create a charge when it contains "information required by the regulations, i.e., an allegation and the name of the accused party,”. Additionally, in cases where "the file could reasonably be interpreted as a request for the agency to take remedial action to protect the employee's rights or resolve a dispute between the employer and the employee," such as when the "filer makes a request," it may be considered a fee acceptable.

First, the court must "take into account the elements necessary to the suer’s defence." Second, the court must find that the claims “are not entitled to the presumption of fact because they are nothing more than conclusions.” Finally, “where there are well-defended factual claims, the court must assume their truth and then determine whether they give rise to a reasonable right to relief.”
Likewise, a reasonable jury might find, through subsequent confirmation, that this constitutional violation was attributable to ASORT, as noted below with respect to the municipal defendants (see Wright, 138 F.Supp.2d at 957-58) or through motiıns of Commander Combs and Team Leader Miller, who have unlimited discretion to determine how the announcement will be carried out (see Doc.

MHV applies to a higher court because of that decision. They argue that the criterion determining the outcome,especially the emphasis on the applicant's plan to broadcast to underserved populations, violates either the Communications Act of 1934, which mandates equitable license distribution, or the Administrative Procedure Act because of arbitrariness.
He asserted three federal claims: (1) the defendants, acting both individually and jointly, and allegedly in conspiracy, deprived Beaman of a fair trial by withholding significant evidence, thus violating Brady (individual liability). (2) that the defendants conspired to deprive Beaman of evidence (conspiracy liability); and (3) the defendants did not intervene to prevent the violation of their rights (non-interference with liability).

Despite the requirement for respondent to process the request for a final decision within sixty (60) days, and the ability to compel suer to file a civil suit within ninety (90) days from the issuance of a final decision, repsondent failed to file a final decision until a month after suer’s civil suit was started.
Underwriting objectives include, among other things, the decision whether to issue a policy, the amount and terms of coverage, and whether to renew or cancel a policy.However, it is not necessary for the insurer to obtain a consumer report in order to evaluate the claim.
First, he argues that the second degree court abused its discretion in admitting the 2006 interview clips, his letter to the prisoner, and the facts he acknowledged in his plea agreement to the 2006 crime. This, he says, is because the danger of unfair prejudice significantly outweighs the evidential value.
Although we believe that the NTSB acted arbitrarily and capriciously in refusing to consider state law requiring Petitioner to pay for legal representation, we highlight several issues on which we have not decided. These issues are left open to the NTSB. Additionally, based on the statute at issue, we hold that Petitioner was subject to fees that entitle him to change fees.

MHV applies to a higher court because of that decision. They argue that the criterion determining the outcome,especially the emphasis on the applicant's plan to broadcast to underserved populations, violates either the Communications Act of 1934, which mandates equitable license distribution, or the Administrative Procedure Act because of arbitrariness.
He asserted three federal claims: (1) the defendants, acting both individually and jointly, and allegedly in conspiracy, deprived Beaman of a fair trial by withholding significant evidence, thus violating Brady (individual liability).

First, he argues that the second degree court abused its discretion in admitting the 2006 interview clips, his letter to the prisoner, and the facts he acknowledged in his plea agreement to the 2006 crime. This, he says, is because the danger of unfair prejudice significantly outweighs the evidential value.
Although we believe that the NTSB acted arbitrarily and capriciously in refusing to consider state law requiring Petitioner to pay for legal representation, we highlight several issues on which we have not decided. These issues are left open to the NTSB. Additionally, based on the statute at issue, we hold that Petitioner was subject to fees that entitle him to change fees.
Similarly, in American Power & Light, the Court approved a delegation to the SEC to take actions as necessary to prevent companies from “unfairly or inequitably distributing] voting power among security holders.” 329 U.S. at 104-05, 67 S.Ct.
Witness, for example,  his continued highlights that Mr. Mitchell could have appealed the September 2003 decision, challenged its determination that new and material evidence had not been submitted, and point out that the VA never respond to the audiogram from December 1973. However, he neglected to address these points, as noted in a previous post at 445. This omission is particularly noteworthy given that the Federal Circuit had previously dismissed nearly identical objections in the Beraud case, as indicated in 766 F.3d at 1406, note 1.
Within this authority, we can "examine the [Veterans Court's] decision on whether to grant a mandamus request that raises a valid legal concern ...

Shinseki, 709 F.3d 1154, 1158 (Fed.Cir.).

While our dissenting colleagues seek to differentiate the Court action here from the action taken in Leavey based on the assertion that the en banc order in this case was "procedural," this characterization overlooks the fact that the en banc order in Rickett was comparable to a dispositive order. It disposed of a substantive legal matter by accepting a misfiled Notice of Appeal and served as the foundation for permitting the appeal to proceed.

Nicholson, 476 F.3d 1379, 1382 (Fed.Cir.2007), where it was determined that, despite the appellant's effort to frame the issue as an equal protection violation, the court lacked jurisdiction to consider it. This was because her argument on this matter seemed directed at the merits of her claim and did not raise a distinct constitutional issue.
Due to this determination, there is no need to examine whether section 5121 of title 38 might not be applicable to FVECF (Federal Veterans’ Education and Compensation Benefits Expansion Act) claims because section 5121 could potentially be overridden by ARRA (American Recovery and Reinvestment Act) section 1002(c), which governs the extent of FVECF survivor claims.

The other sections of § 3.312(c) contain requirements that seem to address the materiality of a condition that contributes to the cause of death. For example, § 3.312(c)(4) states, "there is for consideration whether there may be a reasonable basis for holding that a service-connected condition was of such severity as to have a material influence in accelerating death" (emphasis added).

In addition, the Secretary states that “it is clear [that DC] 5284 is not applicable in this case,” as the straightforward language of that DC "precludes rating a foot condition ... that was not the result of an in-service injury." (Reference: Id.)
Darren L. DeFlanders ("DeFlanders") appeals from the decisions of the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims ("Veterans Court") affirming the decisions of the Board of Veterans' Appeals ("the Board"): (i) finding that DeFlanders had not submitted new and material evidence sufficient to reopen claims for service-connected disability compensation for a left knee disability and spots on the lungs; (ii) denying compensation for spots on the brain; and (iii) denying a disability rating in excess of 10% for non-cardiac chest pain.
Implicit in the Secretary's argument, which aligns with the appellant's, is that the December 2006 Board addressed two separate matters: the effective date and disability rating, each of which can be independently reviewed by the Court or revised based on Clear and Unmistakable Error (CUE). These issues pertain to the appellant's claim for disability compensation for bilateral hearing loss.
The Board did not commit an error in determining that "[t]he period between VA's receipt of notice in January 2009 and its response in September 2009 does not alter the fact that the veteran had knowledge, nor does it lessen his responsibility." (Reference: R. at 9)
616 F.3d 1293, 1297 (Fed.Cir.2010) (Following the determination that "there is no valid basis to differentiate between formal and informal claims," the court concluded that "the implicit denial rule can be applied to conclude the pending status of both formal and informal claims").

Thus, the VA's interpretation of § 3.307(a)(6)(iii) — "as excluding service members who never set foot within the land borders of Vietnam" because there was a low probability that offshore veterans, such as Mr. Haas, were exposed to herbicides — was not unreasonable, "plainly erroneous, or inconsistent with the regulation."

However, the April 2007 and July 2007 VA examinations, the December 2009 private opinion, and the October 2012 opinion from the Director, which constitute the most probative and comprehensive medical evidence, indicate that Mr. Wages's service-connected disabilities did not prevent him from securing non-strenuous or sedentary employment.
Although the Board acknowledged the potential applicability of DC 5280 in light of Mr. Copeland's diagnosis of hallux valgus, it concluded that his condition was only "slight to moderate without surgical resection," and therefore, a separate disability rating was not justified.
Thus, he argues, "[i]t is incongruous to conclude that the [appellant's service-connected bilateral foot disability is 'pronounced' under DC 5276, which is considered a more severe degree of symptomatology than 'severe,' but does not amount to 'severe' under DC 5284." (Reference: Id.)

Obviously, and to the extent further discussion of essential character is even necessary here: the essence of pots and pans is to contain and cook, and they can serve those functions with or without lids; and while lids may complete or boost that purpose, they are only incidental there to and serve no purpose otherwise without the pots/pans to which they are intended to be fitted or combined.
Moreover, under section 5121, a determination of whether benefits that benefits that the deceased claiment has earned based on his service or other criteria, but that are payable to him at some later date should be awarded “must be determined based on evidence that was either'physically or constructively in the [deceased claimant’s] file at the time of his death.” Ralston v.

Where, as here, a prisoner “challenges the very fact or duration of his physical imprisonment, and the release he seeks is a determination that he is entitled to immediate release or a speedier release from that imprisonment, his sole federal remedy is a ordinance used to bring a prisoner or other detainee before the court to determine if the person's imprisonment or detention is lawful.” Preiser v. Rodriguez, 411 U.S. 475, 500, 93 S.Ct.
At oral argument, ST argued that it is clear that no subsequent premium that is paid by the insured to the insurer in order to keep the policy in operation and avail the benefits of the policy accordingly is due under ST’s premium plan because the document setting forth the premium plan, the 2005 Flow Plan, nowhere mentions these premiums being due after the MCL is reached.

However, because the Court had previously cancelled those additional arguments during the September 7 session in court, and because the Court specifically narrowed Defendant's supplemental argument to the issue of § 6308, and because Defendant’s reply raises new issues insofar as neither its supplemental filing nor Plaintiff's response raised those issues, the Court rejects those argument out of hand.
